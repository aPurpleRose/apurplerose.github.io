            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>My name is Alice. I am currently in the 12<sup>th</sup> year of school and going to university soon. In general I like anything related to IT.</p>

            <h2>Why do I have this website?</h2>
            <p>
                1. I think websites should become more common. They tell a lot about who you are, show a timeline of your accomplishments and you stand out when applying for a job.<br>
                2. I am interested in a lot of things (maybe too much at a time) and just wanted to do this, so here I am.
